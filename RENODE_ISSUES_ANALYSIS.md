# Renode Platform Issues Analysis

Based on our testing, here are the specific issues that need to be addressed:

## Memory Addressing Issues

### 1. High RAM Access Problems
```
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE0A] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x20024000.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE0A] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x20024004.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE0A] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x20024008.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE0A] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x2002400C.
```
**Issue**: Stack operations accessing RAM at the very top of memory range
**Current**: RAM mapped 0x20000000-0x20024000 (exactly 144KB)
**Problem**: Access at 0x20024000+ treated as "non-existing peripheral"

### 2. Low Address Peripheral Accesses
```
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x8021DF6] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x0.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x8021E24] ReadByte from non existing peripheral at 0x0.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE0A] ReadDoubleWord from non existing peripheral at 0x18.
```
**Issue**: Missing system memory and low-address peripherals

### 3. Debug/System Control Registers
```
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800BC20] ReadByte from non existing peripheral at 0xF8.
```
**Issue**: Missing ARM CoreSight debug components

### 4. Flash System Memory
```
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE1A] ReadByte from non existing peripheral at 0x1FB.
[WARNING] sysbus: [cpu: 0x800FE1E] ReadByte from non existing peripheral at 0x1FA.
```
**Issue**: Missing system memory region with device ID and option bytes

## Missing Peripherals

### 1. System Memory Region (0x1FFF0000-0x1FFF7FFF)
- Device ID registers
- Flash option bytes  
- Boot configuration
- Factory calibration data

### 2. Debug Components (0xE00FF000+)
- CoreSight debug interface
- Debug authentication registers
- Trace components

### 3. System Control Block Extensions
- Additional SCB registers beyond basic ARM implementation
- STM32-specific system control

### 4. Low Address Handlers
- Null pointer access handling
- Reset vector handling

## Root Cause of Crashes

The firmware crashes when:
1. Stack operations try to access RAM at 0x20024000+ (beyond mapped region)
2. System tries to read from unmapped low addresses (0x0, 0x18)
3. Debug interface access at 0xF8 fails
4. System memory reads for device identification fail

## Proposed Fixes

### Memory Regions
1. **Extend RAM mapping** to include guard region
2. **Add system memory** region (0x1FFF0000+)
3. **Add null pointer region** (0x0-0x1000) with dummy handler

### Peripherals  
1. **Add debug component stubs**
2. **Add system memory with device ID**
3. **Improve SCB implementation**
4. **Add missing GPIO/timer registers**
